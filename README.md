Math Magic
==========
Finally mathematical calculations are painless to implement, just import our libraries and you're ready to go! All without having to deal with the hassle of making your own math library, that takes time from your real work. Our goal is to allow people to use math, and not fall victim to the complexity of its implementations. Math will seem like magic to you with our advanced mathematical libraries.

We libraries from various branches of mathematics, whether it be statistical, applied, you name it, we probably have it.

If you have your own algorithm, feel free to contribute!
