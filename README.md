Math Magic
==========
Mathematical libraries from various branches of math (including calculus and finance).
We primarily use python for all of our implementations, as it is a relativley high level language that is fairly easy to newcomers. As a result, people can pick up math-magic libraries with relative ease, and use them in day to day lives.

C/C++ and many other low leve languages may have thier own speed benefits, but in terms of ease of use for time given, python is far superior in that sense.
