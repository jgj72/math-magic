    <p>Finally mathematical calculations are painless to implement, just import our libraries and you're ready to go! All the power of math, without having to deal with the hassle of implementing it on your own.

Our goal is to allow people to use math, and not fall victim to the complexity of its implementations. We have libraries from various branches of mathematics, whether it be statistical, applied, you name it, we probably have it. Math will seem like magic to you once you get started with math-magic's easy to use libraries in your own projects.

If you have your own algorithm, feel free to contribute!</p>
